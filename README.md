# Configuration Task

For the two different configurations task, there is a development profile and a production profile.
Either launch it by specifying the environment, or a profile has been made where in VS you can use the green play button to choose between the two profiles.

The development profile will launch an in memory database, therefore data does not persist.
The production profile will launch with SQlite, therefore data will persist even after application closes.
